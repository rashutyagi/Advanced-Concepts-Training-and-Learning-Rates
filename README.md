# Advanced-Concepts-Training-and-Learning-Rates
In this repository we have seen how much is the importance of learning rate in training a Deep Neural Network and trust me it is a LOT!!

Dataset used is  CIFAR 10. 

Target was to achieve 88% accuracy in less than 50 epochs.

## I have trained model for 50 epochs.Received 88.38% accuracy in 20th Epoch.Overall best Test accuracy is 93.67 % and Overall best training accuracy is 95.2 %

Here are some of the statistics for the training :-
